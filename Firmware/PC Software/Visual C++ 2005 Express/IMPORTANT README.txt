The MCHPUSB Pnp Demo.exe program was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.
The program is meant to show how to use the MCHPUSB custom class driver to write a smooth
"Plug and Play" aware PC application to interface with the USB device.  Use this application
in conjunction with the "USB Device - MCHPUSB Generic Driver Demo" firmware projects
that distribute with MCHPFSUSB v2.x.

In order to use this program, you will need to have the .NET framework version 2.0
(higher version probably okay, although not tested) installed on your computer.  If you do
not have the .NET framework 2.0 installed, a non-descript error message will occur when trying to 
launch the executable, and the program will not open.  You may also need to install the 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributeable Package.  Both of these packages get automatically installed
when installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.

You may already have the .NET framework installed on your PC, especially if you have already installed
other applications which were built with one of the Visual Studio 2005 .NET languages.  If you do not
yet have it, the .NET framework can be freely downloaded from Microsoft's website.  Users of Windows Vista
do not need to install the .NET framework, as it comes pre-installed as part of the OS.

The redistributables are currently (22 May 2008) available at:

In order to build the PC application source code, you will need to install:
1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition (other editions or later versions are believed to work
	however, this is not tested, and once the project is converted over to a newer version or
	more advanced version, the project will probably not be openable in 2005 Express Edition anymore). 
2. Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK (and follow Microsoft's recommendations for integrating it with the
	VC++ 2005 IDE, which invovles updating the include path among other things)

All of these tools are currently distributed by Microsoft free of charge.  Currently (22 May 2008), they 
can be downloaded from:
